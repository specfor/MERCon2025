            <br>  
            <br>
            Abstract:
            <br>
As large language models (LLMs) become integral to decision-making tasks, from summarizing medical records to answering policy questions, their evaluation and usage must reflect human preferences. This talk traces the lifecycle of a model, from evaluation and selection to deployment in real-world applications. We’ll examine two core challenges: evaluation methods that often produce inconsistent or misleading rankings, and retrieval systems that organize knowledge in overly linear ways, misaligned with how humans reason across connected concepts.
We’ll explore recent advances that aim to align evaluation with human judgment and make retrieval more structurally aware and efficient. These developments reflect a broader shift: moving beyond benchmark scores toward systems that reason, retrieve, and rank in ways that make sense to people, ultimately building AI that is more trustworthy, usable, and aligned with human needs.

           <strong style="color:#e5a84d">From Generative to Agentic: The Quiet Revolution Transforming How We Build AI-Powered Software</strong>
            <br>  
            <br>
            Abstract:
            <br>
              
The generative AI boom captivated the world—but a deeper, more profound shift is now underway. In this keynote, we explore the rise of Agentic AI: a paradigm that transcends content generation and redefines how intelligent software is built, composed, and deployed. This talk traces the arc from pretraining breakthroughs and zero-shot generalization to the rise of prompt engineering—and now, to the dawn of agents that reason, plan, and act autonomously. 
Why is Agentic AI emerging as the new frontier? Because it signals a pivot away from requiring deep machine learning expertise to build intelligent systems. Instead, we’re witnessing the democratization of AI development—where software engineers, designers, and domain experts can compose powerful capabilities using natural language, declarative workflows, and tool-integrated agents. 
Attendees will gain a clear understanding of what Agentic AI is (and what it’s not), how it builds on the foundations of generative AI, and why it's poised to fundamentally reshape the software development stack. We'll unpack the enabling trends, survey leading architectures and toolchains, and look ahead to what the next wave of software creation looks like—less about writing code, more about orchestrating intelligence.

            <br>  
            <br>
            Abstract:
            <br>
              Australia, like many other forward-thinking nations is going through significant transformations in its energy sector.  This is driven by the ambitious decarbonisation targets and the integration of renewable energy sources to the electricity grid.  The next decade will see substantial retirement of conventional rotating synchronous generators (mainly fossil fuel based) considering the aging infrastructure, economic pressures and evolving climate policies.  
The integration of renewable energy sources to Australia’s eastern electricity grid which is one of the longest electricity grids in the world operated by the National Electricity Market is faced with many technical, regulatory and operational challenges.  The aim of this talk is to explore some of the problems faced and associated experiences and examine at a high level how the challenges faced are addressed.
